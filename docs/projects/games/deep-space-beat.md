## Summary

My second participation to the famous [Ludum Dare game jam (edition #48)](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/) compo, and my first released 3D game.  
The theme was *deeper and deeper*.  
I was rated [**239th** overall](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/deep-space-beat) (on *1145* entries in the compo), with a nice *97th position* in the **audio** category.

Tools used:
- Godot Engine
- Blender
- GIMP for textures
- FL Studio for music track

### Description

It's a simple endless 3D tunnel game set in space, with a cool music track.
Use the arrow keys on your desktop, and use the on-display keys on Android (more difficult to play on Android sorry, couldn't make the accelerometer to work without causing a seizure to everybody).
