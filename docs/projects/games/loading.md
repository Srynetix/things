## Summary

My first participation to the famous [Ludum Dare game jam (edition #45)](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/) compo.  
The theme was *start with nothing*.  
I wasn't rated because I couldn't take the time to score other games (my bad).

Tools used:
- Godot Engine 3.1.1
- Bfxr for sound effect generation
- GIMP for textures
- FL Studio for music track

### Description

A little minimal game where you need to grow before crashing to death. You should play it in the browser.
