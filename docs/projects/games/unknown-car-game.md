## Summary

A simple 2D car game where you have to avoid obstacles.  
I made this game to practice before the Ludum Dare 49 ([see my entry here](./dont-drop-it)).  
It was useful to experiment with shaders and full-screen effects (extracted in a custom Godot plugin of mine, [see here](../game-related/my-godot-plugins)).
