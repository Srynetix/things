# Music theory

**Warning: this is a work in progress!**

I'm currently following courses about music theory, and this part of my site will be my course notes.

## Notes & language

Notes are not called the same in the US, versus in France for example.

## Scales

- **H**: Half step (immediately next note)
- **W**: Whole step (two half-steps)
