Hello everyone, I'm **Denis BOURGE** ([@Srynetix](https://github.com/Srynetix)), a 28 year old developer who fell in love with programming while I was in school.  
I love making games and system stuff, open-source if possible.

I'm currently **Lead Developer** at [SharingCloud](https://github.com/sharingcloud/).

## What's in here?

First, you can check my open-source [projects](./projects/), then little [experiments](./experiments/) I'm trying to do when I have time.  

## Bio

I always liked computers since I was a little child, and I'm into programming since I was 12 years old.
I'm particularily interested in game development (and everything around graphics programming, like shaders or demoscene), but also high performance computing (HPC) in general (<abbr title="General-Purpose computation on Graphic Processing Units">GPGPU</abbr>, multi-threaded programming, etc.).  

I also have some years of professional experience in the web development field, particularily with the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework (so with a **Python** backend), but in the end I'm more a *static-typed* language fan.  
That's why I also use **React** with **TypeScript** for the frontend.

I love the open-source way of things, that's why most of my personal projects are (and will always be) open-source, available on GitHub.  
**Knowledge should be shared with everyone**.

### My skills

#### Programming

Programming languages I know quite well or I would like to know more (*not in order*):

- **C++ (and C)**: The first language I learned, tried making a [game framework](./projects/game-related/hx3d-framework.html) with it around 2016. I'm not really using C or C++ anymore, mostly because of Rust.
- **Rust**: The future of systems programming, empowers you to write any kind of software you like with a strict compiler and a steep learning curve, but *soooooo* satisfying at the end that it's difficult going back to another PL.
- **Python**: Your versatile dynamic language, can be used from scientific computing to fast (to write) web development (thanks Django).
- **Ruby**: Beautiful and concise, great for code golfing (I'm less familiar with Ruby than Python, but well!).
- **TypeScript**: Because after using TS, I can't write JavaScript anymore without fearing my code will explode.
- **C#**: Because I don't really like Java, and it is a good candidate for game development (see Unity, or Godot Engine for example)

When I'm not programming, I also like composing music tracks, even if it takes time :notes:.  
But you know what's even more time consuming and fun for me ? [Programming music](./experiments/audio/csound.html) :notes:.
