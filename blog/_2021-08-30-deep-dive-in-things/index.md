Here it is, my first real blog post!

If you read the title, I'm gonna write about this website: **why doing it**, **how it works**, and **what I want to do in the future**.

## Why?

Well everyone has a website or a personal page!  
Back in the days, I did my own personal page multiple times using good ol' hand-written HTML4 and CSS2 and it was great! (and unmaintainable but I didn't care back then).

Now, in 2022, you have all the tools at your disposal do to something great, without reinventing the wheel, thanks to things like *static site generators* (also called **SSG**).  
So that's what I tried to do.

### VuePress

First, I tried <ELink href="https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/">**VuePress v2**</ELink>, without any experience in <ELink href="https://vuejs.org/">**Vue**</ELink>, because it looked simple enough to configure and do what I wanted.  
So in the end, the first deployed version of this site was completely done thanks to **VuePress**!

The thing I really liked was to include custom Vue components in Markdown, so I was making my first Vue components!  
At each opportunity to encapsulate something reusable (like a "project card" or a simple "back button"), I did a component.  

The thing I didn't like was to put all my images at the same place, because it is not possible to store images with articles if you refer to them in Vue components (or I don't know how to do it, I tried looking everywhere but I may have missed something).

So everything was up and running, but I wasn't really happy about it. My lack of understanding and experience around Vue did not help me either.  
So I was thinking: "maybe there is something else, as accessible and at least as configurable than VuePress, but maybe around <ELink href="https://reactjs.org/">React</ELink>", knowing that I have more experience in it?

And the answer is: **yes**, there is something else, it's made by Facebook and it's called <ELink href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</ELink>.
