## Summary

Simple tool to generate basic sounds, inspired from <ELink href="http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html">DrPetter's sfxr</ELink>, made in Rust.  
It's a work in progress.

## Origin

I want to do an audio generator using Rust, and recreating *sfxr* seems like a good candidate to experiment with audio processing, and possibly VSTs.

I have a related audio project in Rust, named [ape](../ape) for **audio processing experiments**.  
The two projects will end together at some point.
