# wasm4-sx - Opinionated wrapper around WASM-4

<ProjectSummary urls={["https://github.com/Srynetix/wasm4-sx"]} />

## Summary

My own [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org) wrapper.

I wanted to do that so I could practice a little "embedded" development (it's kind of embedded as games are exported to WebAssembly).
I used this wrapper to make [wasm4-gol](../../games/wasm4-gol) and [wasm4-unknown-car-game](../../games/wasm4-unknown-car-game).
