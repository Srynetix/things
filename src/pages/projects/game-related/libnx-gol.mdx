## Summary

That's the <ELink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</ELink>, but for the _Nintendo Switch_.  
It was made as a homebrew, using <ELink href="https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx">libnx</ELink>.  
It's also compatible with Linux.

## Origin

Well, after hacking my first Nintendo Switch, I wanted to see what was possible in the homebrew field on that thing.  
So with my rusty C, I decided to do one of the most basic things you can do in terms of graphics, the Game of Life.

## Features

- Generate cells using the touchscreen
- Color is dimming depending on its lifetime
- Simulation can be caused
- Linux compatibility using SDL2
