## Summary

My personal collection of Godot Engine nodes and extensions.

Each time I have to create a node, if I think it could be reused in another game, I put it in here.  
It is mostly useful during game jams like the Ludum Dare!

You can play with a <ELink href="https://srynetix.github.io/sxgd-kitchen-sink/">"kitchen sink" sample/testing project here</ELink>.

### Documentation

I wanted to try out <ELink href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/">AsciiDoc</ELink>, so I made some custom tools around XML class definitions (mostly the same thing that Godot does),
but instead of generating RST, it's AsciiDoc.

You can access the <ELink href="https://srynetix.github.io/sxgd/">rendered documentation here</ELink>.
