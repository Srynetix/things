# Nature of Code in Godot

## Summary

This is an interactive project / tutorial which contains implementations of examples and exercises from the <ELink href="https://natureofcode.com/">Nature of Code</ELink> book, using <ELink href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</ELink> with **C#**.  
You can browse chapters and try the ecosystem simulation.  
Most of the game objects are directly created from scripts (versus dedicated scenes).

## Origin

The day I heard of the Nature of Code book, when I was starting to read it I know I had to implement it to better understand the theory and the examples behind every chapter.  
So I started a Godot project, picking C# instead of GDScript to improve my skills in C#. (and I needed static types!)  
Every aspiring game developer should give <ELink href="https://natureofcode.com/">this book</ELink> a try. :wink:
