## Summary

hx3d was a easy to use and easy to learn open-source 2D/3D game framework, made in modern C++ (C++14 at the time).  
Inspiration was taken from the well-known <ELink href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libGDX</ELink> Java game framework, and many tutorials about game engine programming.

It was written with modularity in mind. Rendering is done using <ELink href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2</ELink>, but it can be swapped with something else quite easily.  
Rendering was done using OpenGL 3+ / OpenGLES 2.0

Cross-platform support is done thanks to SDL2 (it was also compatible with Android and iOS!).

Last commit was made in September 2016, I decided to stop the project, and focus on already existing engines (notably <ELink href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</ELink>), keeping the newfound experience from game engine building for my future games.

## Origin

At the time, I wanted to go full speed in "handmade" game development, even knowing the famous citation _"make games, not engine"_, and I started my crazy challenge of making my own game engine.

I really liked modern C++ (11/14+), and with my experience in OpenGL and SDL, I decided to create a somewhat modular system with standard features, taking inspiration from the libGDX game framework.

At the end, I had a "screen" system, touchscreen support, particle systems, animations, tweens, audio management with automatic BPM detection, a custom 2D physics engine, a custom Entity-Component-System (ECS), and even more things.
