## Summary

One day I was thinking:

> "There is a type of game thing I always like to play, that's Quake/Unreal style fast FPS. What if I try to make something really minimal to emulate this feeling using Godot ?".

And there you go: *osefps*!

It's really far from finished, but this project is one of my most ambitious one at the moment.  
Here are some things developed / in progress:

- A basic camera / aim system
- A dash system by double tapping movement keys
- "Launch platforms" which ejects you far away
- An in-game console !

More to come!
