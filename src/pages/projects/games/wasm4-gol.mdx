## Summary

My first [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org) game!  
It's a simple Game of Life, but made in Rust without the standard library and with no memory allocation.

It was fun to do and it also made me create the [wasm4-sx](../../game-related/wasm4-sx) and [wasm4-tracker](../../game-related/wasm4-tracker) projects.
