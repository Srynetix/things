# My music

You can find it <ELink href="https://soundcloud.com/srynetix">on SoundCloud</ELink>.

## History

I'm making music with all kinds of software since school (the first music tool I used at the time was <ELink href="https://archive.org/details/Music2000CD"><b>Music 2000</b></ELink>, also called **MTV Music Generator** in the U.S.).  
The first professional <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr> I used was <ELink href="https://www.image-line.com/"><b>FL Studio</b></ELink>, then later I tried moving to other DAWs to compare:

- I tried **Cubase**, but I didn't liked the interface, everything seemed overly complex,
- I tried **Logic**, but it's for Mac only, and reminded me a little of Cubase (but the included instruments and effects were great!),
- I tried **Reason**, and I loved the modular rack system, but the sequencer not so much,
- I tried **Ableton Live**, because it seemed like _"the most used DAW by EDM professionals"_, ...and after numerous attempts I gave up,
- ...because everytime, I go back to **FL Studio** :smile: Well it's difficult changing habits...

So yeah, I did a few music tracks, a lot of them lost with _hard-drive wiping accidents_.

Around early 2013, I decided to upload my tracks on <ELink href="https://soundcloud.com/srynetix">SoundCloud</ELink>, and I was frequently releasing until the end of the same year, when I needed to focus more on university.  
Since then, I was not really producing anymore, but I watched videos, tutorials, articles on music production, and of course I need to listen to music at least half an hour a day :notes:!  
Now, I want to go back into music making, particularily in the sound design field, I'm mesmerized by [audio synthesis](../csound) and [I want to create my own software synthesizer](../vst-rust).
