## Summary

My personal collection of Godot Engine nodes and extensions.

Each time I have to create a node, if I think it could be reused in another game, I put it in here.  
It is mostly useful during game jams like the Ludum Dare!

You can play with a "kitchen sink" sample/testing project using the link below.

### Documentation

I wanted to try out [AsciiDoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/), so I made some custom tools around XML class definitions (mostly the same thing that Godot does).
But instead of generating RST, it's AsciiDoc.

You can access the rendered documentation using the link below.
