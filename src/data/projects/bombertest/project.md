## Summary

A simple Bomberman-like clone, made for training purposes. It was made to explore the following domains:

- AI (for bots)
- Procedural generation (for now a stupid level generation algorithm)
- Networking (host/join model with a listen server, with an HTML5 compatible client using WebSockets)
