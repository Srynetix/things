## Summary

My third participation to the famous Ludum Dare game jam (edition #49) compo.  
The theme was _unstable_.  
I was rated 26th overall (on _735_ entries in the compo), with a nice _16th position_ in the **fun** category. :tada:  
The game was also featured in a GitHub post: [A peek inside some of the top games from Ludum Dare 49](https://github.blog/2021-10-25-a-peek-inside-some-of-the-top-games-from-ludum-dare-49/).

Tools used:

- Godot Engine 3.3.3
- sfxia
- Affinity Photo
- FL Studio

## Description

The concept is simple: you have to drag-n-drop a bomb ready to explode to a safer location.  
Instructions are included in the game, but I warn you, it is quite challenging.

If you reach the end without dying once, you may get a surprise! :gift:
