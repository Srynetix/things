## Summary

My own [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org) wrapper.

I wanted to do that so I could practice a little "embedded" development (it's kind of embedded as games are exported to WebAssembly).

I used this wrapper to make [wasm4-gol](/projects/wasm4-gol) and [wasm4-unknown-car-game](/projects/wasm4-unknown-car-game).
