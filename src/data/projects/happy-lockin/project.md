## Summary

My 8th participation to the Ludum Dare game jam (edition #54) compo.
The theme was Limited Space.

I was rated 164th overall (**85th** in Mood!).

Tools used:

- Godot Engine 4.1.1 with sxgd.
- GIMP then Krita
- FL Studio

## Description

Initially, I wanted to play with _Godot Engine 4.2 (version dev 5)_, and it mostly worked for the first 24 hours.

But during sunday morning, as I was playing with the _TileMap_, almost all of my tile colliders just disappeared / were buggy with no reason at all (I think it has something to do with tile rotations, which does not exist in 4.1.1).

Well then, I migrated the project to version _stable 4.1.1_, added more tiles to my tileset, redrew the buggy tiles, and everything was good!

So, the game! This time, I wanted to do something more... moody.

My personal take on the "limited space" theme : _you are limited in your movements, and at the same time, you are trapped_.

I imagined an _action/stealth game_, where you need to escape from where you are kept. To do that, you will have to find all the keys, remove your enemies, and above all avoid the dreaded security scanner.

So be careful, be quick, and collect them all if you want to leave.

Watch out for the secrets. ðŸ˜‰
