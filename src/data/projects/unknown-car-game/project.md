## Summary

A simple 2D car game where you have to avoid obstacles.

I made this game to practice before the Ludum Dare 49 (where I did [Don't drop it!](/projects/dont-drop-it)).

It was useful to experiment with shaders and full-screen effects (extracted in a custom Godot plugin of mine, [sxgd](/projects/sxgd)).

You can also check its "port" to WASM-4 here: [Unknown Car Game for WASM-4](/projects/wasm4-unknown-car-game).
