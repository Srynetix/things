## Summary

My 9th participation to the Ludum Dare game jam (edition #55) compo.

I was rated 153rd overall (**68th** in Innovation!).

Tools used:

- Godot Engine 4.2.1 with sxgd.
- Krita, Blender, Pixelorama
- FL Studio

## Description

Well... I was not really inspired by the theme, but I wanted to do one thing: a 3D FPS game! And things were not as expected to say the least.

That's my second released 3D game (first one for Ludum Dare #48: [Deep Space Beat](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/deep-space-beat)), and I encountered every problem possible. Light issues, modeling issues, CSG issues, texture issues, shader issues, game logic issuesâ€¦ most of which were only my fault and not the engine.

So, in the end, I did a 3D FPS game/demo where you need to escape using a mysterious object you can use to summon the solution. There are no clear objectives in this game, that's why I named it "sandbox" (it will be clearer at the end of the game).

I did by best with the available time for HTML5 support, so it should work, but expect stutter sometimes (and forget about it on MacOS). For a better experience, you might want to run the desktop version.
