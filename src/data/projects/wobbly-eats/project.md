## Summary

My 7th participation to the Ludum Dare game jam (edition #53) compo.  
The theme was _Delivery_.

I was rated 73rd overall (with a nice **9th** place in **Fun**).

Tools used:

- Godot Engine 4.0.2 with [sxgd](/projects/sxgd).
- Inkscape
- FL Studio

## Description

Now that's a fun theme! And once again I choose something "food related" (see my previous game Type-Eat).

So I wanted to challenge **Godot Engine 4.0.2** (being used to the version _3_), and that was **really great**! (_very good job Godot guys_!)

GDScript is **more powerful**, most of the problems I had in the past with the language are no more, and I only scratched the surface of the new things!

For the drawing, I wanted to use Inkscape for once, and I'm really not disappointed. It's super useful, and even with my bad drawings, the result is quite nice!

So it's a **driving game** (or more exactly a **quirky physics-based 2D driving game**), where you have to deliver a food package to customers, but with sand dunes all over the place, so don't drop the food (you would not like it either if the delivery guy dropped your food).

The game got _10 levels_, each with time trials to beat.

So try to be **the best**! :sunglasses:
