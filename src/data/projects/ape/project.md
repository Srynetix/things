## Summary

This is a test project to get a grasp on the field of audio programming in general, using nice available libraries.
In the end, this project will become a standalone audio plugin (like a VST plugin).

It's already capable of generating [bytebeats](https://github.com/TuesdayNightMachines/Bytebeats/blob/master/Bytebeats_Beginners_Guide_TTNM_v1-5.pdf) as a command-line tool.
