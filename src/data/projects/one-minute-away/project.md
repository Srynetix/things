## Summary

My 5th participation to the Ludum Dare game jam (edition #51) compo.  
The theme was _Every 10 seconds_.

Like the last edition, I did the event with friends from work, but directly in our main building at [@sharingcloud](https://www.sharingcloud.com) (with food included!).  
It was really nice, super challenging, we didn't sleep that much but super great overall.  
The hard thing this time was to figure out something innovative and fun on the theme "Every 10 seconds", and I think 3 hours later I had something in mind (just before sleeping!).

I was rated 29th overall.

Tools used:

- Godot Engine 3.5.1 with [sxgd](/projects/sxgd).
- Pixel Studio & Krita
- FL Studio

## Description

Man, this theme was **HARD**. Not just hard but really **HARD**.  
I brainstormed during hours finding a pitch fitting for this theme, so there you go _(narrator voice activated)_:

> Time is collapsing. You, the hero of this story, have to once again save the world by fighting the Time itself, avoiding traps and getting [deeper and deeper](/projects/deep-space-beat).

Here's what the **Time** will do to block you:

- _every 10 seconds_, you will be weaker, slower
- _every 10 seconds_, you will receive a special effect in your face
- but fortunately for you, if you break the _time locks_, you will take precious seconds from the **Time** itself.

If you are too slow to finish the level, consider yourself **frozen until the end of the ages** :hourglass:.

Make sure to finish all the levels, and let me know if you enjoyed the game :wink:.  
...ah and put your headphones on, make sure you play with sound :notes:!
