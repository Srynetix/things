## Summary

My first participation to the famous Ludum Dare game jam (edition #45) compo.  
The theme was _start with nothing_.  
I wasn't rated because I couldn't take the time to score other games (my bad).

Tools used:

- Godot Engine 3.1.1
- Bfxr for sound effect generation
- GIMP for textures
- FL Studio for music track

## Description

A little minimal game where you need to grow before crashing to death. You should play it in the browser.
