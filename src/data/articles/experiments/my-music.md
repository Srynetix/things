## History

I'm making music with all kinds of software since school (the first music tool I used at the time was [Music 2000](https://archive.org/details/Music2000CD), also called **MTV Music Generator** in the U.S.  
The first professional <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr> I used was [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/), then later I tried moving to other DAWs to compare:

- I tried **Cubase**, but I didn't liked the interface, everything seemed overly complex,
- I tried **Logic**, but it's for Mac only, and reminded me a little of Cubase (but the included instruments and effects were great!),
- I tried **Reason**, and I loved the modular rack system, but the sequencer not so much,
- I tried **Ableton Live**, because it seemed like _"the most used DAW by EDM professionals"_, ...and after numerous attempts I gave up,
- ...because everytime, I go back to **FL Studio** :smile: Well it's difficult changing habits...

So yeah, I did a few music tracks, a lot of them lost with _hard-drive wiping accidents_.

Around early 2013, I decided to upload my tracks on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/srynetix), and I was frequently releasing until the end of the same year, when I needed to focus more on university.  
Since then, I was not really producing anymore, but I watched videos, tutorials, articles on music production, and of course I need to listen to music at least half an hour a day :notes:!  
Now, I want to go back into music making, particularily in the sound design field, I'm mesmerized by audio synthesis and I want to create my own software synthesizer one day.

## My music hardware

I don't have that much hardware to make music, but I have at least that:

- A [first-gen AKAI MPK Mini](https://www.amazon.fr/Akai-MPK-mini-MINI/dp/B00466HM28)
- A [first-gen Novation Launchpad](https://www.amazon.com/Novation-Launchpad-Controller-Discontinued-manufacturer/dp/B002TX7B4E)
- A [Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2](https://www.amazon.fr/Plantronics-Backbeat-Kits-Oreillette-Bluetooth/dp/B01MFGYF3I)
- A [Yamaha PSR-E313](https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-PSR-E313-Sensitive-Portable-Keyboard/dp/B000Q6JEPU), not really portable but fun to play with
- A [Teenage Engineering PO-33 K.O!](https://www.amazon.fr/Teenage-Engineering-PO-33-K-O/dp/B079M56Z4G/)
- ...and my beefy desktop computer! (with an _AMD Ryzen 7 3700X_ and _32GB of RAM_)
