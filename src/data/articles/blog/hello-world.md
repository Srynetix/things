Hello, you. And welcome to my new "handmade" personal site / blog / portfolio !

I say "handmade" meaning I wanted to create the project structure and style myself, only using a foundational framework, in this case [SvelteKit].

### Why SvelteKit?

Well to first answer this question there is another question to answer: why [Svelte] at all? To answer that, I will do a quick recap' of my experience, sorry if you don't care that much. ðŸ˜‰

### Back in my daysâ€¦

I'm really not a "front dude", I entered the wonderful world of programming at 12 years old by learning C and C++, thanks to the great [Site du ZÃ©ro] website (now better known as [OpenClassrooms]).

Why program at this age? Because I wanted to make video games, that's why. And i still want it, I'm doing it when I have the time! (when you are passionate, you don't know when to stop).

So yeah, I'm more of a system/backend/game dude with interest in UI and aesthetics in general thanks to my gamedev passion (and I still have very much to learn in this field).

After C and C++, I learned HTML4, CSS2, and not much JavaScript. (I was like 13 at the time, and it was crazy to see your dummy website live). At the time, I was using templates found online, editing them to do what I needed without understanding much about it, but years passed and I was learning more and more.

When I was 17, I started my Computer Science studies, and so during 5 years, I was learning programming at school _and_ at home, so I could improve my skills every year on multiple domains, but still with a focus on system/backend subjects. I fondly remember the OpenGL classes which was mindblowing, doing 3D stuff only with code!

## My frontend quest

During that time, I also did front stuff, at first with the venerable [jQuery], then [Angular JS]. I never released anything at this time, and I also played with the [Phaser] HTML game framework.

Five years later, I started to work as a _web developer_ at the end of my studies, then learned [React] and discovered next-generation JavaScript thanks to [Babel]. And that's now the JavaScript framework I use the most. At first with the ES6 classes, then the functional components, then with [TypeScript]! And in the end, the famous React hooks.

I'm still using React at work with TypeScript, and a little on my personal projects. I also used [Docusaurus], notably for my previous personal site.

But I wanted something else, something as capable but less complex. So I tried [Vue], and it didn't really clicked for me. To me it looks like something in between React and Angular, maybe one day I will come back to it. But I wanted something drastically different.

## Svelte, the contender

So I read about [Svelte]. I read all of the official documentation, and played with it a little. Then, it clicked. It was amazing! The ease of use, the speed, it just worked.

I quickly did my first released application with it: the [GitHub Notifier](/projects/github-notifier), an application I already did with React before. And boy it was refreshing! The final code is simpler and easier to manage. The slot system is really great.

Then, i learned about [SvelteKit]. Looked like a great candidate to replace Docusaurus with a lighter and less opinionated alternative, even if I had to do more things manually.

So that's what I did, and what you're seeing _right now_.

## Then what?

Well, I hope to write more blog posts, on other topics.

As I said before, I'm more of a backend/game dude and what I like the most nowadays is mostly [Rust], my spiritual successor to C++, a language I love to write in.

I'm also using [Godot Engine] and [GDScript] to write games, and I would like to write about that too.

So we will see what will happen next.
