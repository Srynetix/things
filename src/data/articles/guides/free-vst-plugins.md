Here is a list of links to free plugins and samples.

When I'm making music, I try to use a maximum of free samples and plugins, together with _FL Studio (All Plugins Edition)_.

## Plugin packs

### Native Instruments KOMPLETE START

- [**Official link**](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/bundles/komplete-start/")

That's a free pack by Native Instruments containing 7 synthesizers, 9 sampled instruments (through Kontakt Player) and 2 effects.  
You need to have/create a NI account to use them.

### dblue Old Plugins

- [**Website link**](https://illformed.org/)
- [**Direct link (Win32 only)**](https://illformed.org/downloads/illformed_old_vst_plugins.zip)

A great effect pack from [dblue](https://illformed.org/), but it only contains 32-bit plugins for Windows.  
It has **Glitch**, **Crusher**, **Stretch** and **TapeStop**.

## Effects

A well-known multiband compressor in the EDM/Dubstep scene.

Another well-known effect, this time for compression and distortion.  
Quite difficult to find since Camel Audio was bought by Apple.

### ValhallaDSP Freq Echo

> Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful.

> Freq Echo is perfect for dub, Dr. Who, and all of your psychedelic needs.

> Bode-Style Frequency Shifter + Analog Echo Emulation create surprising sonic effects. Subtle chorusing and double tracking to barberpole phasing and flanging to endless glissandos and runaway echos.

## Instruments

### Surge XT

- [**Official link**](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/)

I think Surge XT is the greatest open-source virtual instrument ever released.  
It contains lot of features, you have to go to their website.

### Vital

- [**Official link**](https://vital.audio/)

To me, it's a great free alternative to the massive **xfer Serum** synth.  
The free version contains 75 presets and 25 wavetables.
